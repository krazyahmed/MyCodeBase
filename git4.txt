Git Branching
==============
This is a feature available in Git using which we can create multiple 
branches to work on different functionalites of the same project
By default Git performs all its activites on the master branch.

To see the list of avaliable branches
git branch

To create a new branch
git branch branch_name

To move into a branch
git checkout branch_name

To merge a branch 
git merge branch_name

Downloading from git remote repository
This can be using 3 git commands
1 git clone
2 git fetch
3 git pull

git clone will download the complete remote
repository irrespectice of whether it is already 
present on our machine or not.It also initilises an 
empty folder as a git repository ie it create
a hidden folder called .git

 git clone remo_repositry_url

git fetch will download only the changes or modifications
in the rmeote repository which are not present on
the local repository.These changes will be store on 
a remote branch.We can switch into this branch verify those
changes and then merge them with the master branch

Steps
1 Open git.com
2 go to any repository and modfiy some files
3 commit them in the rmeote repository
4 open git bash and give the below command
  git fetch
5 A remote branch will be created where the changes
  will be saved
  git branch -a
  The above command will show the list of all branches
6 Switch to the new remote branch
  git chekout remote_branchname
7 View the changes.These changes will not be in the 
  master branch
8 To merge them with the master branch
9 checkout into the master branch
  git checkout master
10 git merge remote_branchname

git pull will download the changes and automatically 
merge with the master branch
Steps
1 Open github.com and make some changes
2 open git bash and give the below command
  git pull
3 we will see thaty the changes are automatically
  reflected in the master branch
